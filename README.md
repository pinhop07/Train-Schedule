# Train-Schedule

### Overview

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Train-Schedule

1. I created a Firebase backed train schedule application

2. Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery to render the schedule and admin panel on the web page.

3. Used Firebase to host a globally available set of data that is retrieved and manipulated using Moment.js to provide up-to-date information about various trains' arrival times and minutes to arrival.
